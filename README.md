# Hi, I’m Ansees Adhikari

I’m a university student focused on cybersecurity and DevOps fundamentals. I build practical, security-first projects in Python, work in Linux environments, and containerize systems with Docker to make them reproducible and easy to review.

## Focus Areas
- Security fundamentals (Linux permissions, hardening concepts, basic SOC-style workflows)
- DevOps fundamentals (Docker, repeatable environments, CI-ready repo structure)
- Python engineering (clean code, small tools, practical automation)

## Tech Stack
**Languages**
- Python
- SQL (basics)

**Security / Systems**
- Linux
- Bash (basics)

**DevOps / Tooling**
- Docker
- Git & GitHub
- CI/CD (learning and applying)

**Testing / Quality**
- pytest (recommended for Python projects)
- ruff (recommended for linting)

## Featured Projects

## How I Work
- Small, reviewable commits
- Clear READMEs with setup steps
- Reproducible environments (Docker when appropriate)
- Practical documentation: what it does, how to run it, and what I learned
